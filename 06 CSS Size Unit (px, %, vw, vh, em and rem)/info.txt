Unit -
absolute unit - it is unit where size is fixed everywhere e.g. inch, cm, mm, px
relative unit - it is unit where size is dependent on its parent size e.g. %, vh, vw
    1. px - its a absolute unit
    2. % - it assign size according to its parent's size
    3. vw - it set width according to width of window
    4. vh - it set height according to height of window
    5. em - it is dependent on parent.
            it multiply the em value with its parents px or em or any other value. 
            i.e. if parent has 10px size and if we apply 10em to child element then size of child will become,
            child size with em = 10(parent size in pixel) * value provided with em = __px
            e.g. 10px * 10em = 100px
                where, 10px is size of parent
                       10em is, size given to child
                       100px is, size of child in px
    6. rem - as em deal with parent element rem deals with root element i.e. html element 
             By default root has 16px size
             size with rem = 16 (default root has 16px size) * value provided with rem = __px
             e.g. 16px * 5rem = 80pc
                where, 16px is size of root element
                       5rem is, size given to element
                       80px is, size of element in px

we should not use absolute unit for responsive website
