Display -   
    The way in which elements behave
    three types of Display -
        1. inline - elements who only take that much width required to them. It doesn't respct height and width. Custom margin padding not allowed.
        we can convt inline to block
        2. block - these element always take full width of the screens so next element renders on next line. It also respect custom margin and padding.
        we can convt block to inline
        3. none
        4. inline-block - inline element will allow to use height width magin padding. It will still take only space that much is required

box-sizing 
    when we keep box-sizing : border-box;
        it doesn't change size of box (i.e. element)
        if we gave height 300px and width 300px and applied border of 1 px to it then it will become 301X301 i.e. it will resize our element so to keep height and width same with border and margin and padding we should use border-box as box-sizing
